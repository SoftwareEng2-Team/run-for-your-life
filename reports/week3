N/A for this week.

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** My team and I edited the living document to include all the required information regarding our game concept. 
We also finished and practiced our presentation, which we will present in class tomorrow. 

**What we learned:**  We learned that Mondays and Tuesdays work great for all of us to meet, work together, and discuss ideas. I learned
