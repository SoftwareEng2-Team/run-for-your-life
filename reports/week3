### Keona Abad

N/A

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

We completed and updated the living document and updated our roles to be proper roles. We also created a rough UX design of our application within Figma. 

We learned the complications of our app and the full functionality of our app. We also learned that our schedule is great for everyone. 

One of the main things we are going to have trouble with is creating the mobile application itself. Seeing that none of us have ever built a mobile application before, it may be difficult to try an overcome this challenge within 8 weeks.

- Meet with TA on Thursday (15 mins)

### Connor Sun

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week 
N/A

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

Finished our initial setup for the living document, Github organization, role assignments, presentation, and I finished my Figma design for the mobile view.

We learned how to manage version control as a group/organization and how to work as a cohesive team. Further solidified the shared mental image of what our final product should look like.

We had trouble coordinating meeting times and delegating roles to each member. The project idea is still in its fledgling stages and needs a proper development roadmap. Another issue is that none of us have mobile development experience (even just mobile view I think) so that will need to be decided on by the related members.

- Figure out how to retain players who have lost their lives (3 Weeks)
- Decide how players will 'spawn' with territory (1 Week)
	- Is territory even needed? (<1 Week)
