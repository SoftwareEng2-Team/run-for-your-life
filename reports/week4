## 2. Contributions of Individual Team Members

### James Nichols

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
N/A for this week

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** Our team created our slide show presentation, we also updated our living document and github repository in order to meet requirements. 
We also practice our presentation along with further flushing out ideas our project and planned out the expected timeline

**What we learned:**  We improved our understanding of the project and that Mondays are the best day for people to meet.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  We had trouble coordinating when to meet and there are members that struggle to show up when scheduled so it can make planning and group work difficult. 
Hopefully with the new designated time it will elimate tardiness and allow for more solid working times.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Make correction or recommendation based on feedback from presentation (1 week)

### Calvin Chen

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
N/A for this week.

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:**  Our team dispersed out roles for every memeber, finished our presentation slides, updated our living document and github repository. We were also able
to allocate some time to act out our presentation in the library.

**What we learned:**  We learned many github commands along with a more clear image on how our final product will look like. Not only that, we discovered that every member is
available to work on the project on Mondays at 2pm.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  We had trouble committing to our scheduled meetups on the weekends as everyone was busy, which delayed our progress.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Meet with our TA on Thursday at 2pm to get approval and feedback for the start of our project (1 week)
- Map out how the reward system will work for players (2 weeks)
- Brainstorm with team members to come up with how big of an advantage should monetization have on the game (2 weeks)

### Brian Munger

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
N/A for this week.

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** My team and I edited the living document to include all the required information regarding our game concept. 
We also finished and practiced our presentation, which we will present in class tomorrow. 

**What we learned:**  We learned that Mondays and Tuesdays work great for all of us to meet, work together, and discuss ideas. I learned
about how to Git commands when working with a remote repository. This will be useful when working on our app together. 

**Where we had trouble/stuck:** We had trouble on Monday finding a time that worked for all of us to meet, delaying our progress.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Meet Wednesday at 3 pm before class to practice presentation one more time (~1hr).
- Present our application in class (5 mins).

- Start development of the app on Thursday if possible (2 hours). 

### Shi-Ru Huang

N/A for this week.

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** We finished the updated version of living document, make up the presentation slide, making sure what our individual 
role in the project, we also set up enviorment for our future project.

**What we learned:** We learned that it will be more efficent and smooth when it a in-person group meeting instead of meeting online. And good 
conmunication really establish well fundenmental for not just our team but for keeping the entire project open mind and on track.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  So, since 1/20 is a holiday, not everyone is on campus, it at that time we found out working online might be 
sligthy difficult than we thought.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Meet Wednesday at 3 pm before class to practice presentation one more time (1hr).

**What we've finished:** We assigned roles, updated our living doc, planned a head, and prepared for presenting.

**What we learned:**  We learned that planning for the future can be difficult and noticed that most of the stuff we assigned
is still in the air about and not guaranteed.

There were also times where we had a little bit of trouble communicating but things worked out in the end.

### Keona Abad

N/A

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

We completed and updated the living document and updated our roles to be proper roles. We also created a rough UX design of our application within Figma. 

We learned the complications of our app and the full functionality of our app. We also learned that our schedule is great for everyone. 

One of the main things we are going to have trouble with is creating the mobile application itself. Seeing that none of us have ever built a mobile application before, it may be difficult to try an overcome this challenge within 8 weeks.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Meet with TA on Thursday (15 mins)
- Meet with team before class Wednesday (1 hour)
- Monday or Tuesday team meeting (1 hour)

### Connor Sun

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week 

- Figure out how to reward players for exploring new areas (1 Week)
- Figure out how to retain players who have lost their lives (3 Weeks)
- Decide how players will 'spawn' with territory (1 Week)
	- Is territory even needed? (<1 Week)

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

We have figured out the basics of using Google Maps API and have rendered the map onto a webpage. However, our progress is significantly hampered by the fact that we can no longer use Live Share on VSCode. Working on code is much less efficient now that we all can't participate in the learning process for things like API usage, website design, game programming, etc. This will be an ongoing issue that we just have to figure out. 

Figured out the basics of having players explore new areas. We should move from a mi^2 scoring system to a general point system. We can algorithmically designate lower popularity areas (that are still suitable for running) to naturally give more points. This means that some players will have to run in areas that they generally don't run in. This has some security concerns and lots of bugfixing, so this will have to be implemented much later on unless we can find a better solution that doesn't come with the risks.

Spawning proves to be a much more difficult task without a functioning game prototpye. However, an initial amount of territory is good as we may have bugs without it (easier to get rid of edge cases) and it will center a player and not allow them to freely run around the map and spawn in areas frustrating to other players. Defender's priority takes precedent, so we should reduce the times that higher ranking players get 'sniped' by people respawning

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)

- Finalize the point system (1-2 weeks)
    - Decide the criteria for weighing an area more heavily for points (1 week)
- Research viability of desired monitezation systems (1-2 weeks)
    - Business collaboration viability (1 week)
    - Microtransaction viability (1 week)
    - Privacy-compliant data selling

- Figure out how to retain players who have lost their lives (3 weeks+)
- Decide where spawning would cause the least amount of frustration for all parties (? weeks)
