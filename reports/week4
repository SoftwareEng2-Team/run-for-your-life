- Make correction or recommendation based on feedback from presentation (1 week)
- Begin planning the development and planning out progess milestones (2 weeks)
- Meet with TA on Thursday to get approved and begin working on project (1 week)

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** Our team further clarified the requirements we are planning to meet with our project. We also bagan implented the Google Maps API which we plan to use for the project going forwards. 
We worked as a group for this activity using a share link in VSCode.

**What we learned:**  We improved our understanding of the project and have developed a base level knowledge for how the Google Maps API works.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  We had trouble at first using the API as none of the group has worked with it but by the end we were at least able to develop a basic understanding of the general API along 
with some features that could be helpfule in project.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Improve understanding of the Google API (1 week)
- Begin planning the development and planning out progess milestones (1 weeks)
- Begin developing a basic location tracking software to begin optimizing and testing (2 weeks)


### Calvin Chen

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
- Meet with our TA on Thursday at 2pm to get approval and feedback for the start of our project (1 week)
- Map out how the reward system will work for players (2 weeks)
- Brainstorm with team members to come up with how big of an advantage should monetization have on the game (2 weeks)

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:**  Our team was able to import Google's Geolocation API and have it run locally. We also hardcoded the coordinates of Corvallis's location of 44, -123,
so that we can have a general map to work on in the future.

**What we learned:**  We learned to import Google's Geolocation API and have it run locally. We also learned many commands of Node.js and found out that an extension called
live share in VScode helped accelerate our progress as we were all able to edit multiple files in real-time.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  We had trouble coordinating meetup times besides Monday (due to everyone's busy schedule and have other class meetups), which delayed our progress.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Split up parts of code for everyone to work on and commit changes to github when done (30 min)
- Implement a pin-point location on the map to represent where the player is (1 hr)
- Freely control the players movement on the map (3 hrs)

### Brian Munger

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
- Meet Wednesday at 3 pm before class to practice presentation one more time (~1hr).
- Present our application in class (5 mins).
- Meet with our TA on Thursday (15 mins).
- Start development of the app on Thursday if possible (2 hours). 

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** This week, we met on Monday to start the development of our app. We are implementing it to work on any browser, most likely on mobile devices. We implemented the Google 
Geolocation API, and was able to run it on localhost with it opening up to Corvallis, OR. We experimented with this API and discussed the different functionalities we may want to use.

**What we learned:** We learned how to implement the Google Geolocation API. This includes setting the right permissions, having it load correctly, and displaying the webpage via Node.JS.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:** Delegating the work is a little hard right now since we are so early in development. We worked together to figure out the Google API, and will likely split
roles and responsibilities at the end of the week.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Add marker to Google Maps (30 mins)
- Add navigational capabilities to application (2 hours)
- Delegate work (begin frontend, backend, etc) (10 mins)
- Begin individual tasks (2 hours)
- Meet to discuss progress later in the week (30 mins)

### Shi-Ru Huang

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
N/A for this week.

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** We finished the updated version of living document, make up the presentation slide, making sure what our individual 
role in the project, we also set up enviorment for our future project.

**What we learned:** We learned that it will be more efficent and smooth when it a in-person group meeting instead of meeting online. And good 
conmunication really establish well fundenmental for not just our team but for keeping the entire project open mind and on track.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  So, since 1/20 is a holiday, not everyone is on campus, it at that time we found out working online might be 
sligthy difficult than we thought.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Meet Wednesday at 3 pm before class to practice presentation one more time (1hr).
- Present our slides during class (5 mins).
- Meet with our TA on Thursday (15 mins).
- Start doing individual part of the project after we meet on Thursday(3 days).

### Evan Albert

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
N/A

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** We assigned roles, updated our living doc, planned a head, and prepared for presenting.

**What we learned:**  We learned that planning for the future can be difficult and noticed that most of the stuff we assigned
is still in the air about and not guaranteed.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  We had trouble getting everyone together to work on the project as people were sick/hurt and were unable to meet in person.
There were also times where we had a little bit of trouble communicating but things worked out in the end.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Meet Wednesday at 3 pm before class to practice presentation one more time (~1hr).
- Present our application in class (5 mins).
- Meet with our TA on Thursday (15 mins).
- Start development of the app on Thursday if possible (2 hours). 

### Keona Abad

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
- Meet with TA on Thursday (15 mins)
- Meet with team before class Wednesday (1 hour)
- Monday or Tuesday team meeting (1 hour)

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

We decieded what program and API's we will be using. We set up a good coding enviroment for all of us to be able to work on the project at the same time. We figured out how we are going to be able to ensure that the user stays within the running border.

We learned that there might be a complication in computing the longitude and latitude of the map. 

Pin pointing where the user will start and end might be a difficult task and we are still unsure on how we might complete that task.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Finalize how we will keep track of the point system (3 hours)
- Meet with the team on Wednesday and Thursday (1 hour)
- Finalize a draft of the backend (2-3 hours)
### Connor Sun

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week 

- Figure out how to reward players for exploring new areas (1 Week)
- Figure out how to retain players who have lost their lives (3 Weeks)
- Decide how players will 'spawn' with territory (1 Week)
	- Is territory even needed? (<1 Week)

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

We have figured out the basics of using Google Maps API and have rendered the map onto a webpage. However, our progress is significantly hampered by the fact that we can no longer use Live Share on VSCode. Working on code is much less efficient now that we all can't participate in the learning process for things like API usage, website design, game programming, etc. This will be an ongoing issue that we just have to figure out. 

Figured out the basics of having players explore new areas. We should move from a mi^2 scoring system to a general point system. We can algorithmically designate lower popularity areas (that are still suitable for running) to naturally give more points. This means that some players will have to run in areas that they generally don't run in. This has some security concerns and lots of bugfixing, so this will have to be implemented much later on unless we can find a better solution that doesn't come with the risks.

Spawning proves to be a much more difficult task without a functioning game prototpye. However, an initial amount of territory is good as we may have bugs without it (easier to get rid of edge cases) and it will center a player and not allow them to freely run around the map and spawn in areas frustrating to other players. Defender's priority takes precedent, so we should reduce the times that higher ranking players get 'sniped' by people respawning

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)

- Finalize the point system (1-2 weeks)
    - Decide the criteria for weighing an area more heavily for points (1 week)
- Research viability of desired monitezation systems (1-2 weeks)
    - Business collaboration viability (1 week)
    - Microtransaction viability (1 week)
    - Privacy-compliant data selling

- Figure out how to retain players who have lost their lives (3 weeks+)
- Decide where spawning would cause the least amount of frustration for all parties (? weeks)
