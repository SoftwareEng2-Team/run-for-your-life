#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** Our team created our slide show presentation, we also updated our living document and github repository in order to meet requirements. 
We also practice our presentation along with further flushing out ideas our project and planned out the expected timeline

**What we learned:**  We improved our understanding of the project and that Mondays are the best day for people to meet.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  We had trouble coordinating when to meet and there are members that struggle to show up when scheduled so it can make planning and group work difficult. 
Hopefully with the new designated time it will elimate tardiness and allow for more solid working times.

N/A for this week.

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:**  Our team dispersed out roles for every memeber, finished our presentation slides, updated our living document and github repository. We were also able
to allocate some time to act out our presentation in the library.

**What we learned:**  We learned many github commands along with a more clear image on how our final product will look like. Not only that, we discovered that every member is
available to work on the project on Mondays at 2pm.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  We had trouble committing to our scheduled meetups on the weekends as everyone was busy, which delayed our progress.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)

### Brian Munger

- Meet Wednesday at 3 pm before class to practice presentation one more time (~1hr).
- Present our application in class (5 mins).
- Meet with our TA on Thursday (15 mins).
- Start development of the app on Thursday if possible (2 hours). 

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** This week, we met on Monday to start the development of our app. We are implementing it to work on any browser, most likely on mobile devices. We implemented the Google 
Geolocation API, and was able to run it on localhost with it opening up to Corvallis, OR. We experimented with this API and discussed the different functionalities we may want to use.

**What we learned:** We learned how to implement the Google Geolocation API. This includes setting the right permissions, having it load correctly, and displaying the webpage via Node.JS.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:** Delegating the work is a little hard right now since we are so early in development. We worked together to figure out the Google API, and will likely split
roles and responsibilities at the end of the week.

conmunication really establish well fundenmental for not just our team but for keeping the entire project open mind and on track.

### Keona Abad

N/A

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

We completed and updated the living document and updated our roles to be proper roles. We also created a rough UX design of our application within Figma. 

We learned the complications of our app and the full functionality of our app. We also learned that our schedule is great for everyone. 

One of the main things we are going to have trouble with is creating the mobile application itself. Seeing that none of us have ever built a mobile application before, it may be difficult to try an overcome this challenge within 8 weeks.

- Meet with TA on Thursday (15 mins)

- Monday or Tuesday team meeting (1 hour)

### Connor Sun

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week 
N/A

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

Finished our initial setup for the living document, Github organization, role assignments, presentation, and I finished my Figma design for the mobile view.

We learned how to manage version control as a group/organization and how to work as a cohesive team. Further solidified the shared mental image of what our final product should look like.

We had trouble coordinating meeting times and delegating roles to each member. The project idea is still in its fledgling stages and needs a proper development roadmap. Another issue is that none of us have mobile development experience (even just mobile view I think) so that will need to be decided on by the related members.
