#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
- Meet with our TA on Thursday (15 mins).
- Further dicuss with team member fo the next step on Monday (2hr).

**What we learned:** 
- What I've learn is that in order to make the login authentication work, it must go through the database to retrieve that user's authentication and send it back to log that player in jis own aacount.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**
- What I encounter is that, it really hard to catch up and communicate for the past week, since everyone's schedule did not work well at the same time

### Evan Albert

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
- Finished implementing the login authentication (3 days).
- Meet with our TA on Thursday (15 mins).
- Further dicuss with team member fo the next step on Monday (2hr).

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
- Finished the leaderboard basic implementation. 
- Sorting function and proper CSS is working with more refinements on the way. 
- Game design has been ironed out a lot but specifics are hard to talk about in a simple paragraph.


**What we learned:**  
- We learned how to make the login authentication work and how it must go through the database to retrieve that user's authentication and send it back to log that player in its own account.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**
- Still figuring out testing on a public server.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Start the manipulation of the database from the backend (4 hours)
- Meet with the team on Wednesday and Thursday (1 hour)
- Begin to work on the front-end in the sense it needs to make sure it is properly displaying all the data (2 hours)

### Keona Abad

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
- Start the manipulation of the database from the backend (4 hours)
- Meet with the team on Wednesday and Thursday (1 hour)
- Begin to work on the front-end in the sense it needs to make sure it is properly displaying all the data (2 hours)

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
- Successfully have the frontend, backend, and database hosted through Render.com.
- Routing through each end is hooked up
- Now able to register as a user and log in as a user as a frontend and the data gets stored properly

**What we learned:**  
We have learned that because we are hosting through render, our code requires a lot of bypass strings. We've also learned how to use bcrypt to hash passwords and unhash them when looking at equality.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**
There was some confusion on why, when a user successfully logs in, it kept on routing us to an incorrect window even though our href was setup properly. It wasn't the fact that href wasn't working properly but it was the fact that async defer was not properly loading the scrip,t which was also the reason our map wasn't getting updated at one point. 

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)

- Hopefully finish our polygon for tracking our users route (1-5 hours)
- Meet with the team on Wednesday and Thursday (1 hour)
- I need to be helping on the backend side to be able to have data append properly to the leaderboard the way we need it to. Right now it displays all information if I call the leaderboard and we don't want that.(2 hours)

### Connor Sun

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week 

- Decide where spawning would cause the least amount of frustration for all parties (1 week)

- Figure out if public_html is a viable way to host our website (pushed off because of midterm and other work) (1 week)

- Work on designing backend API specifications given new design expectations (2 weeks)

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
I've not finished much personally since I've had some roadblocks in my life. For the game implementation, live tracking is implemented and what's needed is to implement pathing and spawn territory

**What we learned:**  
I learned the basics of how to draw polygons and am learning how to integrate it with real-time tracking given the constraint of limited API calls per hour

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**
I have had some personal struggles that I'm dealing with that interferes with my ability to work. Furthermore, real-time integration has been a struggle due to the scope of our project progress. 

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)

- Work on designing backend API specifications given that our game is single player for the beta test (1 weeks)

- Implement player spawn territory (1 week)

- Implement player path reaction (1 week)

- Create test cases for path running (1 week)
