## 1. Team Report

### 1.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week

-- Allocate tasks and side-tasks (ongoing weekly, so 1 week every week)
- Solidify design of gameplay loop (1 weeks)
- Build leaderboard frontend and architect it to be able to integrate a database (2 week)
- Update living document to meet the expectations of the Project Architecture and Design specifications (<1 week)
- Implement Run For Your Life (RFYL) on the school servers so we can test it on a non-localhost server (? weeks)
- Ask TA if using a database is the correct way to go about implementing our leaderboard (1 week)
    - Research alternatives to the suggested solution (1 week)
    - Act on the information (2 weeks)

### 1.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
Webapp navigation between leaderboard, map, and profile has been implemented. 
Successfully set up database to store player data and keep track of account information: score, territory and login information.
Present our project and updated living document to meet requirements with the rubric.
Began planning test cases and what software will be used for testing our project. 
Successfully set up the project to run on the school servers so it can be running constantly

**What we learned:**  
We learned how the school public server works and how we can run our site on that server for players to be able to access our game at all times.
Furthermore, we now also have developed an understanding of what is required for setting up the database to hold all the players information. 

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  
We had trouble understanding requirements for the presentation and other assignments in the class since some of the instructions can be difficult to understand.
However, through discussing as a group and asking questions in class we were able to understand what requirements were necessary for the midterm presentation.

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
I finished the buttons for navigating our webapp's frontend. I fixed version conflicts which caused features like geolocation to be erased from our codebase and added QoL changes to the infowindow from that and the test marker we have implemented.

**What we learned:**  
I learned how to use the Google markers thanks to Calvin and infowindows thanks to Brian. I also now know how to make buttons that are interactive based on their image shape as opposed to simple boxes. I learned interesting styling techniques such as adding buttons in the footer/header so they are always ready for the user and how to manage to-be-used files by webapps.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**
The Google AdvancedMarker library was giving me and some others a lot of trouble. I feel kind of guilty for not trying something so obvious as using the simpler Marker library. In the future I will keep my mind open and not shy away from using tools that are said to be deprecated without trying it out myself first.
