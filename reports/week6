## 1. Team Report

### 1.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week

-- Allocate tasks and side-tasks (ongoing weekly, so 1 week every week)
- Solidify design of gameplay loop (1 weeks)
- Build leaderboard frontend and architect it to be able to integrate a database (2 week)
- Update living document to meet the expectations of the Project Architecture and Design specifications (<1 week)
- Implement Run For Your Life (RFYL) on the school servers so we can test it on a non-localhost server (? weeks)
- Ask TA if using a database is the correct way to go about implementing our leaderboard (1 week)
    - Research alternatives to the suggested solution (1 week)
    - Act on the information (2 weeks)

### 1.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
Webapp navigation between leaderboard, map, and profile has been implemented. 
Successfully set up database to store player data and keep track of account information: score, territory and login information.
Present our project and updated living document to meet requirements with the rubric.
Began planning test cases and what software will be used for testing our project. 
Successfully set up the project to run on the school servers so it can be running constantly

**What we learned:**  
We learned how the school public server works and how we can run our site on that server for players to be able to access our game at all times.
Furthermore, we now also have developed an understanding of what is required for setting up the database to hold all the players information. 

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  
We had trouble understanding requirements for the presentation and other assignments in the class since some of the instructions can be difficult to understand.
However, through discussing as a group and asking questions in class we were able to understand what requirements were necessary for the midterm presentation.

- Finish setting up database and create connections between the backend database and frontend (1 week)
- Create login page for players to fill out to create a account on the database (1 week)
- Begin working on location tracking storage and developing the visual line that the player will use to track their run completion (2 weeks)
- Build leaderboard frontend and architect it to be able to integrate a database (1 week)

## 2. Contributions of Individual Team Members

### James Nichols

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
- Return to Corvallis to be abel to work with my group in-person again.
- Work on creating a backend that will hold user profile information.
- Begin creating test plans and bug testing to ensure no problems make it far into development.

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
- Created database to store player information and begin frontend connection to this database
- Put game onto the school servers so the game will have a permanent uptime.
- Finished and presented midterm presentation.

**What we learned:**  
- The school servers provide free deticated servers which can be used to run our project.
- The backend database software can only be edited on a stronger PC so will have to edited on a desktop.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:** 
- Struggle to properly devide work out for each member of the group.
_ As the project takes more shape there will be more things for each member to work on.


#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)
- Create login page for players to fill out to create a account on the database (1 week)
- Begin working on location tracking storage and developing the visual line that the player will use to track their run completion (2 weeks) 
- Work on scoring weights to determine how much a given area show score for the player (2 weeks)

- Midterm presentation feedback emphasized scalability concerns, meaning we need to refine our server architecture to handle more players.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  
- Difficulty integrating the PostgreSQL database with the school-hosted frontend, as direct queries were restricted by server permissions.
- Allocating work to members who were online.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)

- Further discuss into small group on what we gonna do for each of us for the following week
- start the proccess of implementing the login authentication for each user

**What we learned:** 
- What I've learn is that in order to make the login authentication work, it must go through the database to retrieve that user's authentication and send it back to log that player in jis own aacount.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**
- I got trouble to connect tight with my teammate this week due to the injury I've suffer,so it kind of hard to update and know if my current direction is going on well.

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
- Implementing a barrier around the map
- Implementing a marker onto the map which we will use as a player
- Most of the completion on the API implementation

**What we learned:**  
We learned how to manage a large API system and how to gather pre-existing code from external sources that can really help us in our development stage. We also learned how to properly navigate through our local host.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**
I would not say we are completely having trouble with anything at the moment, but right now we are trying to figure out how we are going to host this on a public server

### Connor Sun

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week 

- Finalize the point system (1-2 weeks)
    - Decide the criteria for weighing an area more heavily for points (1 week)
- Research viability of desired monitezation systems (1-2 weeks)
    - Business collaboration viability (1 week)

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
I've finished the prototype leaderboard and designed it such that we can simply read off player data and insert div "cards" for each leaderboard. Since we are just now interacting with our database, it is good to have a stable platform we can read it off of for display debugging.

**What we learned:**  
I learned how to use JS to mass-produce a templated HTML element. In my webdev class, I had difficulty doing this because of the lack of direction and I ended up using a different method to what I have now. We also learned that OSU's public_html may be difficult to interact with, but free hosting is free hosting. 

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**
Figuring out how we can implement a backend on the OSU servers is difficult. In general, I've designed databases before but have never implemented them or worked with them. It was hard to coordinate what exactly we needed to store and how we'd retrieve that in a timely manner.

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)

- Finalize the point system (1 weeks)
- Research viability of desired monitezation systems (1 weeks)
