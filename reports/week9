## 1. Team Report

### 1.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week

- Allocate tasks and side-tasks (ongoing weekly, so 1 week every week)
- Draw polygon with the users location (.5 weeks)
- Have the project fully hooked up to the database (.5 weeks)
- Implement basic multiplayer (1.5 weeks)

### 1.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
- Implemented user account creation with email, username, and password storage. The player is redirected to the login page upon successful registration.
- Added a guide button on the profile page that provides an overview of game mechanics, navigation button functionality, and player instructions.
- Created database queries to retrieve leaderboard information, including player names and total claimed territory.
- Implemented logic to calculate player rank and store it in the database.
- Launched the beta version and recorded a project demonstration video.
- Developed live movement tracking, players' paths are now displayed in real-time as they run.
- Implemented land claiming, when a player completes a closed-loop, the enclosed area is claimed and visually updated on the map.

**What we learned:**  
- How to structure database queries for real-time leaderboard updates.
- The importance of user experience, adding the guide button improves player onboarding.
- Implementing live tracking required careful testing to ensure accurate positioning and land claiming.
- Handling database rank calculations.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  
- Some issues with database queries caused incorrect leaderboard and profile page updates.
- Wi-Fi interreuptions will lead to inaccurate player positioning.
- Scheduling difficulties along with response times.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**
- What I encounter is that, it really hard to catch up and communicate for the past week, since everyone's schedule did not work well at the same time

### Keona Abad

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week
- Start the manipulation of the database from the backend (4 hours)
- Meet with the team on Wednesday and Thursday (1 hour)
- Begin to work on the front-end in the sense it needs to make sure it is properly displaying all the data (2 hours)

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
- Successfully have the frontend, backend, and database hosted through Render.com.
- Routing through each end is hooked up
- Now able to register as a user and log in as a user as a frontend and the data gets stored properly

**What we learned:**  
We have learned that because we are hosting through render, our code requires a lot of bypass strings. We've also learned how to use bcrypt to hash passwords and unhash them when looking at equality.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**
There was some confusion on why, when a user successfully logs in, it kept on routing us to an incorrect window even though our href was setup properly. It wasn't the fact that href wasn't working properly but it was the fact that async defer was not properly loading the scrip,t which was also the reason our map wasn't getting updated at one point. 

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)

- Hopefully finish our polygon for tracking our users route (1-5 hours)
- Meet with the team on Wednesday and Thursday (1 hour)
- I need to be helping on the backend side to be able to have data append properly to the leaderboard the way we need it to. Right now it displays all information if I call the leaderboard and we don't want that.(2 hours)

### Connor Sun

#### 2.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week 

- Work on designing backend API specifications given that our game is single player for the beta test (1 weeks)

- Implement player spawn territory (1 week)

- Implement player path reaction (1 week)

- Create test cases for path running (1 week)

#### 2.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
Finished the majority of geolocation implementation and logic for the user to capture area.

**What we learned:**  
A lot of new interactions with the google maps and geolocation API were learned because of how heavily we use it for the main game feature. A lot of considerations were made to allow the user to claim territory despite the end algorithm being so simple and relatively hands-off.

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**
The database is currently having issues tracking the player's claimed area. It seems to reset their score which messes with the core gameplay implementation because we want to check how much area the user has claimed over time. Console logging has allowed us to determine the logic is correct for score calculation, but users aren't supposed to be presented with console messages for a functioning web app. 

#### 2.3 Plans and Goals for the Following Week (list as bullet points along with estimated time to accomplish)

- Finalize player path completion logic by creating "snapping" to and from the captured boundary (1 week)

- Finalize player 'total area captured' logic—- given it's done by the time the final project is due (1 week)

- Clean up code by adding comments and removing commented-out or redundant code (1 week)

- Finish up documentation of geolocation (1 week)

- Write test cases (1 week)
