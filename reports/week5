# Weekly Status Report -- 20250129

## 1. Team Report

### 1.1 Exact Copy of the Third Section from Last Week

- Allocate tasks and side-tasks (ongoing weekly, so 1 week every week)
- Implement basic Google Maps navigation (1 week)
- Solidify design of gameplay loop (2 weeks)
- Build good organizational management techniques and learn from previous complications (1 week)

### 1.2 Progress and Issues

**What we've finished:** 
Webapp navigation between leaderboard, map, and profile has been implemented. We have successfully used Google's Geolocation API to find the position of our players and can display that and their coordinates on the map. The InfoWindow object now also closes automatically upon a user's action for QoL and the map will continue to be improved. 

**What we learned:**  
We learned how to manage several objects from the Google Maps API and how to combine them to create a detailed game interface. Furthermore, we now understand how to use Google's Geolocation API to find a player's position and can extend that to figure out how to implement live tracking features. 

**Where we had trouble/stuck:**  
We attempted to use the AdvancedMarker library from Google because we were informed the Marker library is deprecated. However, the AdvancedMarker would not render on our map while the Marker library would. This caused us to waste many hours of work through bug-chasing.
