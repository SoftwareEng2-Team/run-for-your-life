High-level Description: Competitive running game that simulates territory acquisition via a completed running route. 
Players compete by claiming the most space on a shared real-world map each week.
To claim space one must create and complete a running circuit of any length.
Upon completion of said circuit, players are rewarded with all map space within that circuit being claimed as their territory regardless of whether it is already claimed. 
The map displays currently existing territories and all in-progress routes by players. A leaderboard will also display the current square miles each player has claimed for that week.
All scores and territories are reset weekly, and the top player is given a flair for the following week.
